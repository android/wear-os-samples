Wear Tiles Sample
=================

![Tile Messaging Screenshot](screenshots/tile_messaging.png)

[Tiles](https://d.android.com/training/wearables/tiles) provide easy access to
the information and actions users need in order to get things done. With a
simple swipe from the watch face, a user can find out the latest forecast or
start a timer.

This repository contains a sample tile built using the [Tiles Material
Components](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/wear/protolayout/material/package-summary)
library (for UI) and [Horologist
Tiles](https://github.com/google/horologist#-tiles) (preview utilities and
Kotlin-friendly wrappers).

Get Started
-----------

Build the project from the command line using `./gradlew build` or import it
into Android Studio to benefit from the IDE shortcuts like direct surface
launching which lets you launch the Messaging tile directly to a device or
emulator in just one click.

For the sample, start with
[`Service.kt`](app/src/main/java/com/example/wear/tiles/messaging/Service.kt);
the layout (with IDE preview) can be found in
[`Layout.kt`](app/src/main/java/com/example/wear/tiles/messaging/Layout.kt).

Golden Tiles
------------

Note: these have not yet been updated to [Material 3
Expressive](https://developer.android.com/design/ui/wear/guides/surfaces/tiles).

The sample also showcases most of the Golden Tile layouts from the [Tiles Design
Kit](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/design/tiles-design-system#tile-templates)
in the `tiles.golden` package of the `debug` sourceset; see
`GoldenTilesPreviewsRow[N].kt`. You may find it convenient to start with one of
these layouts rather designing and coding your own from scratch.

To see what these look like, open one of the "GoldenTilesPreviewsRowN" files and
choose the "Split" or "Design" editor view.
