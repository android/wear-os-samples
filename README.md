======================

This repository contains a set of individual Android Studio projects to help you get started writing Wear OS apps and watch faces.

Read below for a description of each sample.


Samples
----------

* **[ComposeStarter](ComposeStarter)** (Compose/Kotlin) - Demonstrates simple Compose for Wear OS app devs can use as a starting point for their own Compose app.

* **[DataLayer](DataLayer)** (Compose/Kotlin) - Demonstrates communicating via the data layer between the watch and the phone. [Guide](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/data-layer)

* **[WatchFaceFormat](WatchFaceFormat)** - Demos the new Watch Face Format which allows quick development of performant watch
    faces in XML [Guide](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/wff)

* **[Complications](Complications)** (Kotlin) - If you are writing a watch face with complications, this app gives you a full suite of data sources to test against your implementation of complications to make sure it looks good. [Complication Guide](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/watch-faces/adding-complications)

* **[WearOAuth](WearOAuth)** (Kotlin) - Demonstrates how developers can authenticate a user on their Wear OS app via the user's mobile/phone device without requiring a mobile app (Wear OS companion app handles the request on the mobile side). The sample uses OAuth. [Guide](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/auth-wear)

* **[WearSpeakerSample](WearSpeakerSample)** (Compose/Kotlin) - Demonstrates audio recording and playback if the wearable device has a speaker. This is also demonstrate how to handling permissions. [Guide](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/wearable-sounds)

* **[WearTilesKotlin](WearTilesKotlin)** (Kotlin) - Demonstrates tiles using the new AndroidX library. [Guide](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/wear-tiles)

* **[WatchFacePush](WatchFacePush)** (Kotlin) - Demonstrates the Watch Face Push AndroidX Library. [Guide](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/watch-face-push)
