Android WearAccessibilityApp Sample
===================================

Sample demonstrates how to include accessibility support for your wearable app.

Introduction
------------

Accessibility is an important part of any app (especially wearable apps). By
            integrating accessible components and services, you can improve your app's usability,
            particularly for users with disabilities.

            This sample demonstrates common UX patterns in wearable apps along with accessibility
            support of those patterns. Be sure to review the [Accessibility Developer Checklist][1]
            for your own app. For additional information please see our
            [Best Practices for User Interface][2] page.
